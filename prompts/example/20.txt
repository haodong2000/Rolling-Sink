A high-energy choreographed fight performance on a minimalist stage: two performers in playful animal helmets and padded suits exchange fast, clean boxing sequences. The white-suited fighter with a blue spiky helmet presses forward with repeated jabs and feints; the blue-suited fighter with a red helmet pivots back and fires counters, both wearing oversized red gloves and chunky boots. The lighting is theatrical—bright key light from above with a soft rim light, creating strong silhouettes against a black background. The camera tracks laterally from left to right, keeping both fighters centered as they circle and reset.
