A stylish woman confidently catwalks down a bustling Tokyo street as if the street were a runway, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the colorful lights and shadows. Pedestrians move about, adding to the lively atmosphere. Cinematography: Front-facing full-body runway-style tracking shot. The camera leads her and moves backward smoothly in front of her with gimbal-stabilized motion, maintaining a constant distance and constant eye-level camera height. Fixed focal length (35mm), no zoom, no push-in, no pull-back, no reframing. Locked framing: she stays centered (or left-third) and remains full-body in frame at all times; her scale and screen position remain constant throughout (her body height occupies roughly 55–65% of the frame height consistently). Pose and gaze: shoulders square to the camera, chin slightly up, head mostly forward; she maintains strong eye contact with the lens for most of the video (about 85–90%), with only brief natural side glances that quickly return to the camera—no prolonged looking away.
